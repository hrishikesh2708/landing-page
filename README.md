##Description
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

##Instructions
###Mandatory
-The project should have a structure like the one shown below. All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.
All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
-Styling has been added for active states.
-There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.
-Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
-It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
-When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
-Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedure when necessary.
-Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
###Optional
-Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
-Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load).
-Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
-pdate/change the design/content.
-Make sections collapsible
